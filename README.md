# What is this?
- This is a work in progress collection of write-ups for PicoCTF
# What do the write-ups include?
- The write-ups will include the following:
	- The tools you will need
	- Background information on what it is your solving (i.e. Coding languages, Specific software and encryption types)
	- Techniques on problem solving
	- How to solve the CTF itself.
# Why am I doing this?
- This project is being made to help new and experienced people getting into CTF challenges and to help share my knowledge on certain topics.

# My background/specialisation(s) for CTF challenges
- My background for solving CTF challenges are as the following:
	- Cryptography
	- Forensics
	- General Skills
- I tend to specialise in investigation side of things as I have a keen eye/brain for finding patterns and noticing small changes or differences.

# I hope this project will serve whoever reads it well! This will be continued to be worked on as long as PicoCTF makes challanges!
