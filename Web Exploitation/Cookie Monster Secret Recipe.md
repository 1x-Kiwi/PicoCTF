# Tools you will need
- A Web-Browser (No specific type)
- Base64 decocder (https://www.base64decode.org/)
# Description
- Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?
- Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
# Hints
1. Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the web-page?
2. Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
3. Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a web-page, including things you can't see directly.
# How to solve
- To start solving you will first have to launch the instance through PicoCTF. It's a big blue button you can't miss it.
- Once you have launched the instance and are on the web-page you will be greeted with a simple log-in page with a title of "Cookie Monster's Secret Recipe"
- To start you will right-click and select 'Inspect' or press 'F12'
- Once inside the inspect menu navigate over to storage and go to the 'Cookies' section and click the file.
- If you have not noticed there is nothing inside it. How do we solve this? Simply enter something into the login section and click 'Login'.
- Example being "Admin" 'Admin'
- Once you have attempted that you will be greeting with a message saying "Access Denied".
- That message is not important. Take another look at the cookies file. There's something there now.
- Copy the garbled text in the 'Value' tab and copy it (You can now close the PicoCTF challenge tab)
- Open a new tab and navigate to https://www.base64decode.org/ and paste the garbage text in the top box making sure not to change and settings.
- Once it is decoded congratulations you have your flag! Simply copy it and paste it into the PicoCTF submission box and click submit!

# Some background information on 'Base64'

- Each character represents a 6-bit segment of a sequence of byte values.
## Applications of 'Base64'
- Web Pages
- E-Mail Attachments
- Embed binary data in a text file
- Embed binary data in XLM
- Embed PDF file(s)
- Embedded elements
- Prevent delimiter collision
- LDAP Data Interchange Format
## The 'Base64 Alphabet'
- The following table below is the entire 'Base64 Alphabet' (Don't be afraid just because I am)


| value | char | value | char | value | char | value | char |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| 0     | A    | 16    | Q    | 32    | g    | 48    | w    |
| 1     | B    | 17    | R    | 33    | h    | 49    | x    |
| 2     | C    | 18    | S    | 34    | i    | 50    | y    |
| 3     | D    | 19    | T    | 35    | j    | 51    | z    |
| 4     | E    | 20    | U    | 36    | k    | 52    | 0    |
| 5     | F    | 21    | V    | 37    | l    | 53    | 1    |
| 6     | G    | 22    | W    | 38    | m    | 54    | 2    |
| 7     | H    | 23    | X    | 39    | n    | 55    | 3    |
| 8     | I    | 24    | Y    | 40    | o    | 56    | 4    |
| 9     | J    | 25    | Z    | 41    | p    | 57    | 5    |
| 10    | K    | 26    | a    | 42    | q    | 58    | 6    |
| 11    | L    | 27    | b    | 43    | r    | 59    | 7    |
| 12    | M    | 28    | c    | 44    | s    | 60    | 8    |
| 13    | N    | 29    | d    | 45    | t    | 61    | 9    |
| 14    | O    | 30    | e    | 46    | u    | 62    | +    |
| 15    | P    | 31    | f    | 47    | v    | 63    | /    |

Notice how it only goes up to '64'? That's because we started at '0'. Computers are weird don't ask me about it.
