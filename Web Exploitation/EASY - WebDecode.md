# Description
- Do you know how to use the web inspector?
# Hints
1. Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page
2. The flag may or may not be encoded

# How to solve
- Start the instance on PicoCTF and navigate to the website they provide.
- You will be greeted with a simple homepage most of which we will be ignoring.
- You will want to navigate to the 'About' page. Here is where you can start to inspect.
- While inspecting you will notice in one of the HTML elements there is a 'notify_true' argument with a bunch of garbled text. This is what we are after.
- Double click on the garbled text and copy it. We can now close the challenge website.
- Open a new tab and navigate to ([base64 website](https://www.base64decode.org/)).
- In the top box paste the garbled text and decrypt it.
- Congratulations you now have your flag! Paste it in the PicoCTF submission box and click submit!
