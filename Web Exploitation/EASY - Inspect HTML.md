# Tools you need
- A Web-Browser (Any works)
- A working keyboard and mouse

## Description
- Can you get the flag?
	- Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
## Hints
1. What is the web inspector in web browsers?
# How to solve
- To start launch the instance from the PicoCTF website and navigate to the tab that they provide you with.
- Once you navigate to that tab you are greeted with a short blurb on 'Histiaeus' (Pretty cool topic btw would recommend reading about it).
- To find the flag either right-click and select 'inspect' or press 'F12'
- Once you open the 'inspect' menu direct your eyes to the HTML code (Website code). Here you will notice green text this is called a 'comment' and are often formatted as the following
```
<!-- According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. -->
```
- Inside this comment will be your flag.
- Simply copy the flag and paste it into the submission box and click submit!
